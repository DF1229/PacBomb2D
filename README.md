# PacBomb2D
This project was part of a school assignment.
The goal was to learn more about game development, and discover if it is something for me.

The game is a mix between Pacman and Bomberman, made in Unity (version 2021.1.27f1).
Main features include:
- Pacman can lay bombs instead of eating the ghosts
- Touchscreen support in the UI
- Controller support

The project taught me a lot about game development, and I can see myself returning to Unity at a later date.
For now I want to focus on my portfolio website, after which I might dabble with a VR/AR game.
